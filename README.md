# MASCADO

Package for analyzing geometric distortions of optical systems.  This
software is meant for quick-look inspection of distortion data sets.

The documentation is available at https://tychons.net/mascado/  
If you want to build it yourself, get Sphinx and run

    $ make docupdate
    $ make docbuild

Then open `./docs/build/html/index.html`.

There are a few unit tests for the package, though not nearly
extensive.  Run with

    $ python -m unittest discover --start-directory tests

or

    $ make test
